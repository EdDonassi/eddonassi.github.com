                 <h2>A star is born</h2>
                <p>JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995, the biggest competitor of Internet Explorer at that time. It's purpose was to bring interactivity to the web. Indeed, at that time, the web was static, since only HTML and CSS were used.</p>

                <h2>The evolution of JavaScript</h2>
                <p>Dispite security and performance issues, JavaScript use was growing rapidly (no other alternative available at that time). So more and more browsers started adding support to it. Until it became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. With google making chrome V8 (javascript engine) in open source, we had the apparition of node js. And beacause of the performance of the chorme v8 engine, web apps started to become quite peroforming.</p>

                <p>It is an easy language to start with. And you can use it for the backend of a web page, or for desktop or mobile apps if you like.</p>
